        <h1>The Hidden Cost of Medical Spa Software Integration Failures</h1>
        <p>
          When your loyalty platforms, POS, and EHR systems don’t communicate, your spa’s operations suffer. 
          Manual reconciliation, duplicated entries, and incomplete records become the norm—and the costs compound quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Operational Time Loss</h2>
        <p>
          Staff spend hours every week trying to cross-check transactions between Alle, Aspire, and the POS. 
          This not only wastes time but creates opportunity cost from missed client interactions.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Financial Leakage</h2>
        <p>
          Unmatched redemptions and unclaimed rewards mean thousands in lost revenue. Integration failures create blind spots in your reporting and bookkeeping.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Client Experience Damage</h2>
        <p>
          A client redeems rewards—but your system doesn’t record it. Now they’re charged incorrectly or need manual correction. Trust erodes fast.
        </p>
        <h2>4. The Fix</h2>
