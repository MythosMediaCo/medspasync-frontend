## 2. Architecture Design

### 2.1 Data Flow Architecture
```
[Client Application] 
    ↓ (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
[Load Balancer/API Gateway]
    ↓ (Internal TLS)
[Authentication Service]
    ↓ (Encrypted)
[Application Services]
    ↓ (Encrypted Database Connection)
[Encrypted Database]
```

### 2.2 Security Zones
- **Public Zone**: Marketing site, public APIs
- **DMZ Zone**: API Gateway, Load Balancer
- **Application Zone**: Core application services

### 3.2 Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Deploy session management with automatic timeouts
- [ ] Implement least privilege access principles
- [ ] Set up automated user provisioning/deprovisioning

### 3.3 Phase 3: Monitoring & Compliance (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Deploy real-time security monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated compliance reporting
- [ ] Set up incident response procedures
- [ ] Conduct security awareness training

### 3.4 Phase 4: Validation & Certification (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Perform comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing
- [ ] Validate compliance with HIPAA requirements
- [ ] Obtain third-party certification

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Database Security
```sql
-- Example: Encrypted column implementation
CREATE TABLE patients (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    encrypted_name BYTEA, -- AES-256 encrypted
    encrypted_ssn BYTEA,  -- AES-256 encrypted
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Audit trail table
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    action VARCHAR(100),
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    record_id UUID,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    ip_address INET,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 4.2 API Security Headers
```javascript
// Security headers implementation
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

### 4.3 Authentication Service
```javascript
// Multi-factor authentication implementation
const mfaService = {
  async generateTOTP(userId) {
    const secret = await this.getUserSecret(userId);
    return speakeasy.totp({
      secret: secret,
      encoding: 'base32',
      window: 2
    });
  },
  
  async verifyTOTP(userId, token) {
    const secret = await this.getUserSecret(userId);
    return speakeasy.totp.verify({
      secret: secret,
      encoding: 'base32',
      token: token,
      window: 2
    });
  }
};
```

## 5. Compliance Controls

### 5.1 Access Control Matrix
| Role | Patient Data | Medical Records | Billing Data | Admin Functions |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Patient | Read Own | Read Own | Read Own | None |
| Provider | Read Assigned | Read/Write Assigned | Read Assigned | Limited |
| Admin | Read All | Read All | Read/Write All | Full |
| Auditor | Read Only | Read Only | Read Only | Audit Logs |

### 5.2 Audit Requirements
