# Module: Transition & Monitoring

- **Durable Workflows:** Use DBOS Transact for all operations that migrate functionality from the legacy system. This ensures atomicity and rollback capability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use Apache Pulsar for event-driven compliance monitoring.
- **Observability:** Implement monitoring with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry. Create a custom Prometheus gauge named `democratic_legitimacy_score`.
