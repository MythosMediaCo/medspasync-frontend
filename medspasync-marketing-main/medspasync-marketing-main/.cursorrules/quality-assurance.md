# MEDSPASYNC PRO QUALITY ASSURANCE MODULE
# Testing, Security, and Quality Standards

## TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage for business logic
- Integration tests: API interactions and data flow
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys
- Visual regression tests: UI consistency
- Performance tests: Core Web Vitals

### Testing Tools
- Vitest for unit and integration testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Lighthouse CI for performance testing
- Storybook for component documentation

## DEPLOYMENT & CI/CD

### Build Process
- Optimized production builds
- Asset optimization and compression
- Source map generation for debugging
- Bundle analysis and reporting
- Environment-specific configurations

### Quality Gates
- Automated testing on all commits
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Accessibility compliance checking
- SEO validation

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- README files for complex components
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- API documentation with examples
- Component storybook documentation

### User Documentation
- Feature guides and tutorials
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Performance optimization guides
- Accessibility guidelines
- Deployment and maintenance docs

## AUTONOMOUS DEBUGGING PROTOCOL

### Systematic Debugging Approach
1. **Reconnaissance**: Analyze error patterns and context
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: Create 3-5 potential root causes
3. **Targeted Testing**: Design tests for each hypothesis
4. **Iterative Resolution**: Fix issues systematically
5. **Validation**: Ensure no regressions introduced

### Debugging Tools
- Comprehensive logging and error tracking
- Performance profiling and monitoring
- Browser dev tools integration
- Network request analysis
- State inspection and debugging

This quality assurance module ensures all code meets high standards for testing, security, documentation, and debugging capabilities.
