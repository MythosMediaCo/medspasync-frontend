# ROI and Business Metrics Patterns

## BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE PATTERNS

### ROI-Focused Feature Development
- All new features must include ROI calculation capabilities
- Implement interactive demos for complex features
- Include quantified metrics: time savings, revenue recovery, accuracy rates
- Follow success story patterns: customer profile + specific metrics + transformation
- Maintain trust indicators: 97% match rate, HIPAA compliance, 24-hour setup
- Use proven messaging: "8+ hours weekly", "$2,500+ monthly", "95%+ accuracy"

### Business Metrics Integration
```javascript
// Always include these business metrics in new features
const businessMetrics = {
  timeWasted: { value: '8+', unit: 'hours weekly', description: 'lost to manual reconciliation' },
  revenueLoss: { value: '$2,500+', unit: 'monthly', description: 'in missed revenue' },
  aiAccuracy: { value: '98%', unit: 'accuracy', description: 'AI matching rate' },
  implementation: { value: '24', unit: 'hours', description: 'setup time' }
};
```

## DATA ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

### Externalized Business Logic
- Externalize all business logic to `src/data/` directory
- Create structured data files: features.js, pricing.js, navigation.js
- Use helper functions for data manipulation and formatting
- Maintain separation between UI components and business logic
- Follow established patterns: features array with id, title, description, icon, benefits
- Implement metric objects: value, unit, description, icon structure

### Data Structure Standards
```javascript
// Feature data structure pattern
export const features = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Feature Title",
    description: "Feature description with quantified benefits",
    icon: { type: "path", props: { /* SVG props */ } },
    benefits: ["Benefit 1", "Benefit 2", "Benefit 3"]
  }
];

// Helper functions pattern
export const getFeaturesByCategory = (category) => {
  return features.filter(feature => feature.category === category);
};
```

## CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS

### Marketing and Conversion Strategies
- Include trust indicators in all new features
- Implement social proof patterns: testimonials, case studies, metrics
- Use risk reduction elements: guarantees, transparent pricing, free trials
- Follow established CTA patterns: primary/secondary button hierarchy
- Implement lead capture: forms, calculators, interactive tools
- Use proven messaging frameworks: problem → impact → solution → proof → timeline

### Conversion Element Patterns
```tsx
// Trust indicator pattern
<div className="trust-indicators">
  <div className="trust-item">
    <span className="trust-icon">✓</span>
    <span className="trust-text">97% Match Rate Accuracy</span>
  </div>
</div>

// CTA pattern
<button className="btn-primary">
  Start Core Plan - $299/month
</button>
```
