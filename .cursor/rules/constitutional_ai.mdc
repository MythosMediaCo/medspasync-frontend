# Module: Constitutional AI

- **Constitutional Validation:** All AI agents MUST validate their decisions against the principles in `@docs/governance/CONSTITUTION.md`.
- **Agent Design:** Use the Mastra or KaibanJS frameworks for building multi-agent systems. Ensure each agent has a clearly defined role (Legislative, Executive, Judicial).
- **Consensus Mechanism:** For decisions requiring agent consensus, implement a Raft-based algorithm using the `consensus.raft.js` or `liferaft` libraries.
