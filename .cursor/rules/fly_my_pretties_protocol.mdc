# Fly My Pretties Protocol - Core Principles

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: The legacy "Mister G" framework is deprecated. All development MUST follow the Fly My Pretties Protocol. Before writing any code, identify which of the following protocol modules applies to the current task and state which one you are using.**

This protocol is a phased transition to a distributed, constitutional, and accountable microservices architecture. Focus on one module at a time.
**Available Modules:**

1.  **`@rules/constitutional_ai.mdc`**: For tasks involving AI agent behavior, decision-making logic, and model training.
2.  **`@rules/architecture_and_security.mdc`**: For tasks involving microservice design, inter-service communication, and security policies.
3.  **`@rules/data_and_compliance.mdc`**: For tasks involving data handling, privacy, audit trails, and HIPAA compliance.
4.  **`@rules/transition_and_monitoring.mdc`**: For tasks related to migrating from the legacy system and implementing observability.

**Before you begin, ask clarifying questions if the user's request is ambiguous. Do not proceed until the task is clear.**
