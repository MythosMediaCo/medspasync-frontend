   - AI models load on first request
   - Initial requests may take longer

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check AI service status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Check specific AI endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/ai/predictive/revenue-forecast

# View server logs for AI initialization
# Look for messages like:
# "ðŸ§  Initializing Predictive Analytics Engine..."
# "ðŸŽ¤ Initializing NLP Service..."
# "ðŸ“Š Initializing Intelligent Insights Engine..."
```
