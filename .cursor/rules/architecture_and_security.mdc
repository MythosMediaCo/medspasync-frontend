# Module: Architecture & Security

- **Microservice Architecture:** Decompose new functionality into loosely-coupled microservices.
- **Service Mesh:** Secure all inter-service communication with mTLS. Your default choice should be Istio.

- **Policy as Code:** Use OPA Gatekeeper to enforce architectural and security policies defined in the `/policies` directory.
