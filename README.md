# MedSpaSync Marketing Site

This repository contains the marketing website for **MedSpaSync Pro**, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Development

1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run a development server with hot reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Production Build

Generate optimized static files in the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

The site can then be served from the `dist` directory or deployed to a static hosting service such as Netlify.

## Project Structure

- `src/` – React components, pages and styles
- `index.html` – entry HTML file
- `tailwind.config.js` – Tailwind configuration
- `vite.config.js` – build configuration

## Assets

Provide your own `favicon.ico` and `logo192.png` in the project root for PWA and browser icons. These files are not included in the repository.
