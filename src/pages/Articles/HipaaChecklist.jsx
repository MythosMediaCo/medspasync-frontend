          HIPAA Compliance Checklist for Medical Spa Automation
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Medical spas handle protected health information (PHI) — from intake forms and treatment notes to photos and payment details — which means they fall under HIPAA regulations. Non-compliance isn’t just a legal issue; it erodes patient trust and can lead to hefty penalties. Civil fines start at <strong>$127 per violation</strong> and can reach <strong>$1.9 million</strong> for serious offenses.
        </p>

        <ul className="space-y-6 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>🔒 Data Encryption (At Rest and In Transit):</strong><br />
            Ensure all PHI is encrypted using industry standards like AES-256 for stored data and TLS for data in transit.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>👥 Access Controls and Role-Based Permissions:</strong><br />
            Every staff member should have a unique login with access limited to only the information necessary for their role.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>🧾 Audit Trails:</strong><br />
            Your software must log who accessed or edited PHI and when. These logs are critical for accountability and breach investigations.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>🔐 Secure User Authentication (MFA):</strong><br />
            Require multi-factor authentication for software access to prevent breaches from stolen or weak passwords.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>⏲️ Automatic Logoff:</strong><br />
            Automatically log users out after inactivity. This prevents unauthorized access from unattended devices.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>💾 Data Backup & Disaster Recovery:</strong><br />
            Regular encrypted backups are required. Confirm your vendor has a disaster recovery plan and fast recovery SLA.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>📄 Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):</strong><br />
            Any vendor handling PHI must sign a BAA. Avoid platforms that won’t provide this — it's a red flag.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>🎓 Employee Training & Support:</strong><br />
            Your software should support team training — through tooltips, modes, or vendor documentation — and provide responsive compliance support.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4">⚠️ Common Compliance Gaps in Spa Software</h2>
        <ul className="space-y-5 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>🚫 Using generic POS platforms:</strong> These often lack encryption, RBAC, and audit logs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🚫 Shared logins:</strong> Violates HIPAA’s unique user ID requirement and kills traceability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🚫 Insecure communications:</strong> Texting or emailing PHI without a secure platform risks data exposure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🚫 No regular risk assessments:</strong> HIPAA requires periodic review of your software for vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🚫 Missing documentation:</strong> Privacy and incident response policies must exist and match what your software supports.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-600">
          HIPAA compliance isn’t a one-time box to check. It's a continuous process of monitoring, documentation, training, and technology updates. Choose software with compliance built-in so you can scale confidently — without compromising patient trust.
