### **Phase 2: Outreach Strategy (Week 2-3)**

#### **2.1 "Free Analytics Audit" Campaign**

**Campaign Message:**

- **LinkedIn**: Direct messaging to spa owners
- **Email**: Personalized outreach with audit offer
- **Phone**: Follow-up calls to qualified prospects
- **Industry Events**: Conference networking

#### **2.2 Competitive Displacement Scripts**

**Zenoti Displacement Script:**
```
"Hi [NAME], I noticed you're using Zenoti for your medical spa. 
We've found that Zenoti users typically spend 15+ hours weekly 
on manual reconciliation and miss 8-15% revenue optimization 
opportunities due to batch processing delays.

Would you be interested in a free analytics audit to see exactly 
how much time and money you could save with real-time insights?"
```

**Mindbody Displacement Script:**
```
"Hi [NAME], I see you're using Mindbody for your medical spa. 
While Mindbody is great for scheduling, their analytics are 
limited to basic reports that take days to generate.

We'd love to show you how AI-powered predictions could help 
you forecast demand and optimize staffing in real-time. 
Interested in a free audit?"
```

**Vagaro Displacement Script:**
```
"Hi [NAME], I noticed you're using Vagaro for your medical spa. 
Vagaro is solid for basic operations, but their integration 
capabilities are limited, which often leads to manual work 
and data silos.

We'd love to show you how our 25+ API integrations could 
automate your entire workflow. Free audit to see the difference?"
```
