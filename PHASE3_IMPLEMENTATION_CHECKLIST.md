# MedSpaSync Pro - Phase 3 Implementation Checklist

## 1. Foundation & Security
- [ ] Remove any real secrets from code/config files
- [ ] Validate all production secrets are in Azure Key Vault
- [ ] Audit all routes for authentication and RBAC middleware coverage
- [ ] Implement/extend device and network verification for zero-trust
- [ ] Run/verify database migrations for RLS and encrypted columns
- [ ] Confirm application-layer encryption for all PHI fields
- [ ] Ensure audit logging middleware is active in all services
- [ ] Test and review audit logs for completeness and retention

## 2. API Modernization
- [ ] Validate all endpoints are documented in OpenAPI 3.0
- [ ] Test rate limiting for all critical endpoints
- [ ] Integrate circuit breaker middleware for critical services
- [ ] Ensure all endpoints are versioned (e.g., /v1/)

## 3. Data Architecture Enhancement
- [ ] Run enhanced schema migrations (Prisma/SQL)
- [ ] Implement multi-level caching (memory, Redis, DB)
- [ ] Enforce data retention and archiving policies

## 4. Monitoring & Compliance
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- [ ] Automate compliance report generation (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)
- [ ] Set up alerting for suspicious activity and security events

## 5. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Run load and performance tests on all services
- [ ] Optimize database queries and caching strategies
- [ ] Implement and test scalability improvements (auto-scaling, CDN)
