        <h1>HIPAA Compliance Checklist for Medical Spa Automation</h1>
        <p>
          Medical spas handle PHI—protected health information—and that makes HIPAA compliance non-negotiable. Here’s how to make sure your software stack is up to the task.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Data Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          All PHI should be encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS protocols. This protects sensitive data even if intercepted.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Role-Based Access Control</h2>
        <p>
          Staff should only access what they need. Unique logins and RBAC prevent privacy violations and satisfy the “minimum necessary” rule.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Audit Trails</h2>
        <p>
          Your platform should log all access to PHI—including who viewed or edited a record, and when.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
        <p>
          MFA helps prevent unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Auto Logoff</h2>
        <p>
          Inactive sessions should automatically log out. A crucial safeguard for shared devices.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Backups & Disaster Recovery</h2>
        <p>
          Regular, secure, and tested backups ensure data can be restored in the event of breach or failure.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Signed BAAs</h2>
        <p>
          Any software vendor handling your PHI must provide a Business Associate Agreement. If they won’t—don’t use them.
